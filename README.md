# Quake Map

This application was designed and developed by [Esri](http://www.esri.com/)'s [Applications Prototype Lab](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/apl/) in Redlands, California.

The live application is available [here](https://github.com/richiecarmichael/Esri-Quake-Map).

The application is built using the following technologies:
[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) ([beta](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/)) by Esri

Earthquake data consists of 10,835 seimic events from 1900 to July 2015 with magnitudes of six or greater on the [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale). The data was downloaded from the [USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/)'s [ANSS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/anss/) [Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). Information on the [largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_earthquakes#Largest_earthquakes_by_magnitude) and [deadliest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes_on_record) earthquakes was sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Seismic events hightlighted red in the chart indicate those events within a one year period, or half a year either side of the red line.
